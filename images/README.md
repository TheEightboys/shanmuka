# Hero Background Images

This folder contains background images for the hero sections on each page.

## Required Images

Place your background images in this folder with the following names:

- **contact-bg.jpg** - Background for the Contact page (recommended: engineering drawings, blueprints, technical equipment)
- **resume-bg.jpg** - Background for the Resume page (recommended: desk workspace, engineering tools, designs)
- **projects-bg.jpg** - Background for the Projects page (recommended: project work, CAD models, prototypes)
- **publications-bg.jpg** - Background for the Publications page (recommended: research setting, technical papers, academic environment)

## Image Specifications

- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Recommended size**: 1920px × 600px or larger
- **Aspect ratio**: Wide landscape format (16:9 or similar)
- **File size**: Optimized for web (under 500KB recommended)

**Style tips:**
- Use high-quality, professional images
- Images should be dark or have good contrast for white text overlay
- Technical/engineering-themed images work best (blueprints, CAD drawings, equipment, workspace)

## How It Works

The CSS applies a dark gradient overlay (75-85% opacity) over your background images, ensuring the white "CONTACT ME" / "RESUME" / etc. text remains readable.

If no background images are added, the hero sections will display a dark gradient as a fallback.

## Example Sources

You can find suitable images from:
- Your own technical drawings or project photos
- Stock photo sites (Unsplash, Pexels) - search for "engineering blueprint", "technical drawing", "CAD design"
- Photographs of your workspace or equipment
